00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.920
SOME EDITS IN SUBTITLE MODE In your work, you quote Nietzsche quite a bit, his line,

2
00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:10.540
he who has a why to live for can bear almost any how.
A 
MULTILINE EDIT


3
00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:13.560
What do you think he meant by that?

4
00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:17.040
What do you think he meant by that?

5
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.860
The same as I am intended to convey to my readers and students,

6
00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:27.440
that the vision of a meaning ahead of someone,

7
00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:32.720
a meaning in wait for someone to be fulfilled by someone,

8
00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:38.240
that this contributes most than anything else

9
00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:44.720
under equal circumstances for survival.

10
00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.600
Meaning is the most important thing in our lives?

11
00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.600
Certainly, because what I call a will to meaning,

12
00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:57.220
the wish to find and to fulfill meaning

13
00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:00.920
is the basic motivation in human beings.

14
00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:06.720
This certainly runs counter to much of the determinist notions

15
00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.140
that are being bandied around about these days

16
00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.160
as man is a machine, man is a computer,

17
00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:14.760
man is a product of instincts.

18
00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.680
Man is something like a rat in experiments,

19
00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:21.640
psychological experiments.

20
00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:25.640
Of course you are right, but not only against

21
00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:29.840
the so -called deterministic concepts of man,

22
00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:33.640
but also regarding the motivational theories

23
00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.600
of certain psychotherapeutic systems.

24
00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:41.460
Let's talk for a minute about logotherapy,

25
00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.340
which arose out of this notion of a search for meaning.

26
00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:50.780
Logotherapy is one among other types of psychotherapy,

27
00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:57.180
is, we may say, a meaning -centered psychotherapy.

28
00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:00.780
In as much particularly as logotherapy

29
00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:07.180
sees a human being not predominantly determined,

30
00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:10.360
not to say dominated, by the will to pleasure,

31
00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:14.560
as you were mentioning, nor by the will to power

32
00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.040
along the lines of Adlerian teachings,

33
00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.560
but basically, fundamentally, by a will to meaning.

34
00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:26.120
That is to say the desire, the impulse,

35
00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.880
to find, to discover in life, or better to say

36
00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:34.180
in each life situation, concrete life situation,

37
00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:38.540
confronting someone, the desire to find a meaning therein

38
00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:41.080
and to go on to fulfill it.

39
00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:42.240
I was very intrigued.

40
00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.840
One of the most surprising things I've read recently

41
00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:52.160
was that you said that when you talked to European students,

42
00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:57.160
only 40 % said they had suffered this sort of inner void,

43
00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:02.600
and yet 81 % of American students experience the same thing.

44
00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:03.880
This was decades ago.

45
00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:05.300
We think of it just the opposite.

46
00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:09.180
We think of the Europeans as being buried under this

47
00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:13.880
existential dread and sense of purposelessness,

48
00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:16.040
and Americans as being optimistic and upbeat.

49
00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:20.860
However it might be, whether the ones or the others

50
00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:25.720
are suffering more or less, respectively,

51
00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:27.920
from this existential vacuum,

52
00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:32.160
the ones who seem to suffer less

53
00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:36.120
should not look at the others with contempt,

54
00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:40.080
but look at the others with compassion

55
00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:47.340
and look for anything possible to help the others.

56
00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:51.220
Now this void manifests itself as apathy.

57
00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:55.960
In apathy, in boredom, lack of initiative,

58
00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:00.180
lack of interest in the world,

59
00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:06.140
or initiative in changing something within the world for the better.

60
00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:13.240
This frustration is a proof

61
00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:16.040
of the existence of a will to meaning.

62
00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:19.940
Unless we were imbued by a will to meaning,

63
00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:22.140
by the wish to find meaning and discover

64
00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:25.660
and fulfill meaning in life,

65
00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:28.800
we never would be able to experience an inner void.

66
00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:32.140
So this is in a way also something positive.

67
00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:35.320
Now you've listed three types of values.

68
00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:38.620
Creative values, experiential values, and attitudinal values.

69
00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:41.640
You may find a meaning, the average man,

70
00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:44.360
the man on the street or the woman on the street,

71
00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:49.300
may find a meaning day by day in doing a deed,

72
00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:51.640
in creating a work.

73
00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:54.060
That's the creative.

74
00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:58.740
Creative, and in experiencing something,

75
00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:02.940
the beauty, the truth, the researcher,

76
00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:08.820
or the good in dealing with people as a teacher or whatsoever.

77
00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:12.420
There's an extraordinary moment in Man's Search for Meaning

78
00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:15.500
where you talk about being in one of the Nazi camps

79
00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:18.620
and all of you going out to look at a sunset.

80
00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:20.420
Is that experiential?

81
00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:25.180
Exactly. This is a paradigm of experiential values,

82
00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:29.040
of finding a meaning in experiencing without doing anything,

83
00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:32.100
without achieving or accomplishing anything,

84
00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:36.120
but just in giving oneself the immediate experience

85
00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:39.960
of something beautiful going on in the world.

86
00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:42.020
This is the second avenue.

87
00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:49.020
But there is also another aspect of experiential values.

88
00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:54.920
Not only experiencing something,

89
00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:57.620
but also experiencing someone.

90
00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:02.180
More than that, experiencing another human being

91
00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:04.980
in his or her very uniqueness.

92
00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:09.640
It is the main attribute of a human being

93
00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:14.140
that he is a person in contrast to any animal.

94
00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:19.480
A person is always something absolutely unique,

95
00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:22.760
irrepeatable in the evolution of the cosmos,

96
00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:26.560
incomparable with any other human being.

97
00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:33.680
And this uniqueness can be got hold of solely by a loving person

98
00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:36.540
because he not only sees the essence,

99
00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:40.280
but also the potentials in the beloved person.

100
00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:44.580
Thereby, as I put it before, promoting him, alleviating it,

101
00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:49.100
to reach out to attain this potential and to fulfill

102
00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:52.460
and thereby actualize also himself.

103
00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:56.220
But not by preaching self -actualization.

104
00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:57.400
It's nonsense.

105
00:06:57.700 --> 00:07:02.520
Self -actualization can only fall into your lap automatically

106
00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:06.400
once that you have fulfilled a concrete meaning,

107
00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:08.640
done the best of a situation.

108
00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:12.300
Then you actualize yourself as a byproduct.

109
00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:14.600
Let's talk about the third set of values,

110
00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:16.960
which is the attitudinal,

111
00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:23.440
the idea of choosing how to respond to suffering.

112
00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:25.000
Choosing the attitude.

113
00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:25.460
Yes.

114
00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:29.580
If there is no possibility in a given situation

115
00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:34.760
to fulfill the meaning of a situation

116
00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:39.460
by giving oneself to the experience of beauty and so forth,

117
00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:45.680
nor if you have lost the capability to do your job,

118
00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:46.920
to do your work,

119
00:07:47.460 --> 00:07:49.460
even then there is an ultimate possibility

120
00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:52.460
to find and fulfill meaning.

121
00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:54.820
Not only the ultimate,

122
00:07:55.100 --> 00:08:01.600
it is even the potential to fulfill the deepest meaning,

123
00:08:02.140 --> 00:08:04.500
to attain the highest values.

124
00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:09.800
By your approach to this situation,

125
00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:13.420
a tragic or a sad situation confronting you.

126
00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:17.120
You said that in part of the initial shock

127
00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:19.980
of being put in a death camp

128
00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:26.320
was ultimately an acceptance that we knew we had nothing to lose

129
00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:28.500
except our ridiculously naked lives.

130
00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:31.760
Is that the situation that they're in?

131
00:08:33.180 --> 00:08:34.080
In a way.

132
00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:38.080
Is this when you make the choice of how you're going to...

133
00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:42.340
your last value choice is how to react to the situation?

134
00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:44.880
You stand there, you stood there naked

135
00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:48.320
with nothing you could have had,

136
00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:53.940
but all the more what counted and mattered was what you were,

137
00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:58.680
being rather than having, possessing anything,

138
00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:02.940
or the being.

139
00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:07.900
So what counted was what you make out of the situation,

140
00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:12.600
what attitude you adopt in the situation.

141
00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:14.820
And there's a multitude,

142
00:09:15.460 --> 00:09:19.220
a wealth of possible attitudes to how to approach it.

143
00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:20.700
So we have to decide.

144
00:09:21.940 --> 00:09:24.220
The ultimate, I would take it,

145
00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:27.660
attitudinal value challenge that we all share

146
00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:30.220
is how we're going to face death.

147
00:09:32.180 --> 00:09:34.220
How do you prepare people for that?

148
00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:35.940
How do you prepare yourself for that?

149
00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:43.460
I couldn't prepare anyone else unless I would have prepared myself.

150
00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:47.700
Because you, if you were a psychiatrist,

151
00:09:47.980 --> 00:09:51.680
your patients feel exactly whether or not

152
00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:56.860
you are really convinced of what you are teaching and telling them.

153
00:09:56.860 --> 00:10:02.900
Now, I'm convinced that in contrast to the usual aspect,

154
00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:06.120
albeit sound aspect, to life,

155
00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:10.420
and more specifically to the past,

156
00:10:10.700 --> 00:10:12.900
to life's transitoriness,

157
00:10:13.420 --> 00:10:18.140
and this includes that each of us is approaching death.

158
00:10:18.620 --> 00:10:26.000
In contrast to that, I maintain that in the past nothing is lost,

159
00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:32.280
but right on the contrary, everything is stored forever.

160
00:10:33.380 --> 00:10:36.440
It is not annihilated by transitoriness,

161
00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:42.420
but on the contrary, it is becoming preserved forever.

162
00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:46.000
Something you have done can never be undone.

163
00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:48.000
Something you have experienced,

164
00:10:49.140 --> 00:10:52.360
something you have even experienced in a negative sense,

165
00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:54.280
going through suffering.

166
00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:56.020
And if you have, for instance,

167
00:10:56.180 --> 00:11:01.400
if you have gone through this suffering honestly, courageously,

168
00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:04.360
and with dignity, who in the world,

169
00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:08.200
what in the world can annihilate this?

170
00:11:08.620 --> 00:11:13.280
What you have done has been done forever in both ways,

171
00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:16.760
in a negative as in a positive way.

172
00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:18.900
It cannot be undone.

173
00:11:18.900 --> 00:11:25.120
And the past is a storehouse of what you have done,

174
00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:28.660
what you have experienced, what you have gone through,

175
00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:33.900
and what you have done out of all the negative and tragic aspects

176
00:11:34.780 --> 00:11:37.560
as even encountered within your life.

177
00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:39.000
I want to thank you for being on the show,

178
00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:40.420
and I want to thank you at home for watching.
