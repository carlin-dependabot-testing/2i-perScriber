What do you think he meant by that? The same as I am intended to convey to my readers and students, that the vision of a meaning ahead of someone, a meaning in wait for someone to be fulfilled by someone, that this contributes most than anything else under equal circumstances for survival. Meaning is the most important thing in our lives?"

Logotherapy is one among other types of psychotherapy, is, we may say, a meaning -centered psychotherapy. In as much particularly as logotherapy sees a human being not predominantly determined, not to say dominated, by the will to pleasure,"
